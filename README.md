# The Machine

**The Machine** is an experimental, real-time survival simulation and engine-building game,\
developed as a Progressive Web App (PWA).\
The player manages a single abstract machine that continuously produces tokens, consumes energy,
and\
becomes increasingly energy-hungry as output rises and accumulates wear over time. The goal: survive
as long as possible before the system collapses.

---

## ⚠️ Status

This project is **actively developed with multiple modules implemented**.\
Core systems (energy, wear, tick cycle, heat) are fully functional.\
UI layout and live updates are stable, with a dynamic modular system and evolving economy.

---

## 🧰 Current Features

- Real-time tick cycle with live updates
- Fully functional modular system with multiple modules:
  - **Vault** (increases token capacity, raises wear rate)
  - **Generator** (increases token production, generates heat)
  - **Battery** (increases energy capacity, affects energy cost scaling)
  - **Cooling** (reduces heat, consumes energy)
- Dynamic **energy**, **output**, **wear**, and **heat** meters
- Interactive **action buttons** with dynamic scaling based on module upgrades:
  - **Buy Energy** (cost scales with Battery, refills energy)
  - **Repair Wear** (cost scales with Vault, reduces wear)
- Automatic enable/disable logic based on current state and resource availability
- Visual icons via Material Symbols for consistent UI
- Heat system now functional, affecting wear accumulation

## 🎯 Core Goal

**There is no winning state.** The machine is designed to collapse.\
Modules don't solve problems — they delay failure while creating new pressures.\
Your score is how long you can keep it running before the inevitable breakdown.

- Survive as long as possible → **score = time survived**
- Keep the machine alive by:
  - Managing **energy** and its increasing cost
  - Managing **wear** and **heat** accumulation through repairs and strategic upgrades
  - Installing and upgrading **modules** to balance output and system stress

## 🔁 Core Loop

The machine runs in continuous **ticks** — short real-time intervals that represent system cycles.

Each tick:

- Produces tokens (`+🪙`) influenced by Generator modules
- Increases energy cost (`↑⚡ cost`) influenced by Battery modules
- Accumulates wear (`+wear%`) amplified by heat and Vault modules
- Accumulates heat (`+heat`) generated by Generator and reduced by Cooling modules

The player can take actions (buy energy, repair wear, or upgrade modules) at any time —\
but time, wear, and heat accumulation never stop.\
When energy reaches **0** or wear hits **100%**, the machine fails.

## ⚙️ System Overview

All key systems are connected through one feedback loop:

```
Output ↑ → Token Capacity ↑ (via Vault) → Wear Rate ↑ → Collapse (at 100%)
                                    ↖----------- Repair ↓

Energy Cost Growth (via Battery modules)
Heat Generation (via Generator) → Heat → Wear Amplification
Cooling modules reduce Heat
```

- Output/actions generate heat.
- Heat builds from Generator modules and amplifies wear.
- Cooling modules reduce heat but consume energy.
- Wear is the primary collapse condition (at 100%). Energy 0 also fails.
- Energy cost growth scales with Battery modules, adding a time-based pressure.

## 🔩 Modules & Bays – Building the Machine

The machine consists of multiple **bays** arranged in a fixed layout.\
All bays exist from the start and can be installed or upgraded by the player.

- **Fixed structure:** no random shop or rerolling. All potential modules are visible.
- **Start state:** basic energy, output, wear, and heat systems active.
- **Modules implemented:**
  - **Vault** – increases token capacity but raises wear rate per level
  - **Battery** – increases energy capacity and scales energy purchase cost
  - **Cooling** – reduces heat but consumes additional energy
  - **Generator** – increases token production and generates heat
- **Activation:** inactive bays can be installed anytime for a cost, adding their effects to the
  system.
- **Upgrading:** installed bays can be enhanced, increasing benefits and drawbacks.

---

## 💥 Wear & Heat Dynamics

**Wear** accumulates each tick (base: 2%/tick) and is amplified by heat and module upgrades (e.g.
Vault).\
**Heat system** is now functional: generated by Generator modules and reduced by Cooling modules.\
Heat amplifies wear accumulation, increasing system stress.\
Overheating alone does not cause failure; only when wear reaches 100% does the system collapse.

---

## ⚡ Events & Market Dynamics (Planned)

Occasional events and market shifts add unpredictability to the system:

- **Energy price drift:** trends upward over time, with small fluctuations per tick.
- **Instability events:** temporary modifiers to tick speed, heat generation, or consumption.
- **Emergency actions:** one-time relief options (e.g., temporary battery injection).

Events are rare but impactful — designed to disrupt routines and force adaptive play.

## 🎨 Interface & Experience

- Minimal, abstract interface resembling a machine control panel.
- Each element of the machine — from stats to modules — appears as a **Bento card** within a unified
  grid.
- The entire layout acts as a single, dynamic dashboard where every tile represents part of the
  machine’s system.
- Tiles can vary in size and purpose, depending on the information or interaction they represent.
- As the machine evolves, new tiles activate and fill the grid, making progress visually tangible.
- Visual and audio feedback communicate system stress (tick pulse, alerts, color shifts).
- Designed for clarity under pressure, adaptable to both mobile and desktop.
- Style: sleek, high-tech, industrial — no decorative illustrations.

## 🎮 Controls

- **Buy Energy** → costs 3🪙 (scales with Battery), adds +5⚡
- **Repair Wear** → costs 5🪙 (scales with Vault), reduces wear by -10%
- **Module Install/Upgrade** → costs scale per module and level, with distinct effects:
  - Vault: increases token cap (+10), raises wear rate (+1%/tick)
  - Generator: increases token output (+3/tick), generates heat
  - Battery: increases energy capacity, scales energy purchase cost
  - Cooling: reduces heat (-20 heat per level), consumes energy
- Buttons disable automatically when insufficient tokens or caps/limits reached
